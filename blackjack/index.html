        <p class="instructions">Instructions: The goal of the game is to get 21 "points". Press the 
            "START NEW GAME" button, then click the "NEW CARD" button if you want the dealer to deal 
            you a new card. If you go over 21, you lose and must start a new game. Once you get to 21, 
            you win. Congratulations, you don't get anything. Good luck!
